# Secondary Mushroom

## Project Overview
The "Secondary Mushroom" project is a machine learning-based classification system designed to identify mushrooms based on their characteristics. This project explores various machine learning models to improve classification accuracy, with a focus on feature engineering, data handling, and deep learning enhancements.

## Models Implemented
Several machine learning models were tested, and their performance was evaluated:

1. **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**
   - Best Parameters: {'C': 10, 'kernel': 'rbf'}
   - Accuracy: 82%

2. **Decision Tree Classifier**
   - Best Parameters: {'max_depth': 20, 'min_samples_split': 10}
   - Accuracy: 83%

3. **Random Forest Classifier** *(Best performing model)*
   - Best Parameters: {'max_depth': 20, 'min_samples_split': 2, 'n_estimators': 100}
   - Accuracy: 86%

4. **Gradient Boosting Classifier**
   - Best Parameters: {'learning_rate': 0.1, 'max_depth': 5, 'n_estimators': 100}
   - Accuracy: 84%

5. **Gaussian Naive Bayes**
   - Accuracy: 65%

6. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
   - Best Parameters: {'n_neighbors': 7, 'weights': 'uniform'}
   - Accuracy: 85%

## Enhancements & Future Improvements

### Deep Learning Exploration
- Implement **Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to improve accuracy by capturing complex patterns.
- Use **Transfer Learning** with pre-trained models for better feature extraction.
- Explore **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** if sequential data is available.

### Model Updates
- Establish a pipeline for continuous model improvement by incorporating **newly collected mushroom data** periodically.
- Use **online learning** and **periodic retraining** to ensure adaptability to new data trends.
- Implement **concept drift detection** to update the model when performance degrades.

### Imbalanced Data Handling
- Use **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** to generate synthetic samples for underrepresented classes.
- Implement **undersampling** techniques to balance the dataset.
- Apply **cost-sensitive learning** to handle class imbalance by adjusting misclassification penalties.

### Feature Engineering
- Introduce **domain-specific features**, such as habitat, environmental conditions, and geographical location.
- Apply **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction to remove redundant features.
- Use **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)** for automated feature selection to improve model performance.

## Conclusion
The "Secondary Mushroom" project successfully explored various machine learning techniques for mushroom classification, with the **Random Forest Classifier achieving the highest accuracy (86%)**. The results demonstrate that ensemble methods outperform simpler models like **Na√Øve Bayes**, which struggled due to its independence assumptions. This project highlights the potential of machine learning in biological classification tasks, providing reliable predictions with balanced precision and recall.

## Limitation
One key limitation of this project is its **dependence on the dataset's quality and diversity**. If the training data lacks sufficient variation, the model may struggle to generalize well to new mushroom species, potentially leading to misclassifications in real-world applications.
